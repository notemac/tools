[How to make windows explorer preview scripts and other text files](https://superuser.com/questions/1320812/how-to-make-windows-explorer-preview-scripts-and-other-text-files)
1) Install [*Node.js*](https://nodejs.org/en/)
The answer came from this link this link as music2myear mentioned but the accepted answer in that link did not work for me.

What worked for me was 2nd answer in the thread. Member user255627 points out the correct key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.py which requires attribute PerceivedType   REG_SZ   text.

I created an attribute in this key with reg command. You can substitute .py with any extension type and enable a bunch of extensions this way. No need for a external program as mentioned in other thread.

from windows command prompt cmd.exe

reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\.py /v PerceivedType /t REG_SZ /d text
If you don't have reg permissions to HKLM (local machine) you can use HKCU (current user)

reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\.py /v PerceivedType /t REG_SZ /d text
You can query like this.

reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\.py /s

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.py
(Default)    REG_SZ    Python.File
PerceivedType    REG_SZ    text
Thanks for the help guys. very useful.
